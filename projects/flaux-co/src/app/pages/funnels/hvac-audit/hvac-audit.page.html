			<h2>Where HVAC Revenue Leaks Happen (And Why They Hurt)</h2>
			<p>
				Most HVAC shops don't need more leads — they need to <strong><em>stop losing the good ones they already get</em></strong>.
			</p>
			<ul class="problem-list">
				<li>
					<strong>Missed or after-hours calls:</strong> Emergency no-heat / no-cool calls going to voicemail or straight into your competitors' pockets.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Slow response to web leads:</strong> Submitted forms and messages sit for hours; the customer books with whoever responds first.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>No system for quote follow-up:</strong> Big-ticket install estimates sent once and never chased.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Weak Google reviews & maps presence:</strong> Competitors with better reviews get the first call every time.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>No central CRM:</strong> Customer history, maintenance plans, and past quotes live in inboxes, spreadsheets, or not at all.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="problem-sting">
				Every one of these is a <strong>silent revenue leak</strong>. The audit shows you how big that <em>opportunity cost</em> is — and how to fix it <strong>FAST</strong>.

		<!-- WHAT THE AUDIT INCLUDES -->
		<section id="what-you-get"

			<h2>What You Get in Your Free HVAC Lead Leakage Audit</h2>
			<p>
				This isn't a generic "marketing report." It's a focused breakdown of <strong>how your shop handles real-world calls and leads</strong>.
			</p>

			<div class="audit-grid">
				<article class="audit-item">
					<h3>1. Missed Call & Speed-to-Lead Assessment</h3>
					<span class="audit-phase-chip discovery">Discovery Call</span>
					<p>
						We estimate how many high-value jobs you're likely <b>losing to missed calls</b>, after-hours calls, and slow responses to web leads and messages.

				</article>
				<article class="audit-item">
					<h3>2. Quote & Estimate Follow-Up Review</h3>
					<span class="audit-phase-chip discovery">Discovery Call</span>

				</article>
				<article class="audit-item">
					<h3>3. Google Reviews, Social Media & Local Visibility Snapshot</h3>
					<span class="audit-phase-chip snapshot">Snapshot Report</span>

				</article>
				<article class="audit-item">
					<h3>4. Website Conversion & Lead Capture Checkup</h3>
					<span class="audit-phase-chip snapshot">Snapshot Report</span>
					<p>

				</article>
				<article class="audit-item">
					<h3>5. CRM & Customer Lifecycle Review</h3>
					<span class="audit-phase-chip discovery">Discovery Call</span>

				<h2>Why AI Dispatch & Automation Matter for HVAC Right Now</h2>
				<p>
					<em><b>Homeowners don't wait around.</b></em> When the AC dies or the heat goes out, they call the first company that responds.
				</p>
				<ul class="ai-benefits">
					<li><strong>AI phone agent:</strong> Answers every call 24/7, gathers details, and books jobs into your schedule.</li>
					<li><strong>AI SMS & chat:</strong> Instantly responds to web leads, Facebook messages, and after-hours inquiries.</li>
					<li><strong>Automated quote follow-up:</strong> Nurtures big-ticket install estimates until the customer is ready to say yes.</li>
					<li><strong>Automated review engine:</strong> Requests Google reviews after each job and funnels unhappy customers to you privately.</li>
					<li><strong>CRM integration:</strong> Keeps everything organized so you know who called, what they needed, and what's next.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The audit shows exactly where these tools would make the <strong>biggest and fastest impact</strong> in your business.
