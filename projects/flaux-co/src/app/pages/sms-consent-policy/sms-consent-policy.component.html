                This page describes the SMS consent process for the Flaux AI Agency demo program. The purpose of this program is
                to demonstrate our advanced AI Voice Agent service to prospective clients in industries such as HVAC, Plumbing,
                and related home services. During scheduled demonstrations, qualified leads will receive a limited number of
                demonstration text messages showcasing the capabilities of our AI agents.

            <h2>Consent Method: Verbal Consent During Scheduled Demos</h2>
            <p>
                All consent for demo messages is obtained verbally and explicitly requested by a Flaux AI Agency representative
                before any demonstration messages are sent. This ensures that each prospect has a clear understanding of what to
                expect and has explicitly agreed to participate in the demonstration.
